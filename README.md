**Data Tales Unfolded** is a project aimed at visualizing world university rankings data for the years 2011-2023. The project seeks to make it easy for anyone to access and compare university rankings data, allowing for a better understanding of how universities around the world are performing over time.

The project is designed to allow users to select two universities for comparison, with rankings data for each institution displayed side-by-side. The user can then view how the universities have performed over the years, with the data displayed in easy-to-read charts and graphs. The charts and graphs display various aspects of university performance, such as overall ranking, research impact, and reputation.
