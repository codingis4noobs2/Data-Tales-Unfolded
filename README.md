**Data Tales Unfolded** is a project aimed at visualizing world university rankings data for the years 2011-2023. The project seeks to make it easy for anyone to access and compare university rankings data, allowing for a better understanding of how universities around the world are performing over time.

### The project is designed to allow users to select two universities for comparison, with rankings data for each institution displayed side-by-side. The user can then view how the universities have performed over the years, with the data displayed in easy-to-read charts and graphs. The charts and graphs display various aspects of university performance, such as overall ranking, research impact, and reputation.
